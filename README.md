# PlanePilot

### Description

Another Top-Down Shooter Clone was initially ported to LibGDX from A 'Sprite Kit' Tutorial to get the basic Game nailed down. Much more is still in store on the Graphical Side. We also plan on a *complete artwork replacement* (in-house) with advanced GPU Shader effects. Also the Sound front will feature all new HD quality effects and music. Stay Tuned. Seb.
