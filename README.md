# PlanePilot

### Description

Another Top-Down Shooter Clone was initially ported to LibGDX from A 'Sprite Kit' Tutorial to get the basic Game nailed down. Much more is still in store on the Graphical Side of this. We plan on a complete artwork replacement with advanced GPU shader effects with lights and shadows (in 2d). Also the Sound front will feature all new HD quality effects and music.
